# Assignment #13: Shoe Store

**This assignment is a virtual shoe store, perfect for the pandemic going on. View this project at: walker.rout.ca.**

## Getting Started With the Project

> This project is fairly intuitive, all one must do is either download it and open it on their computer, or visit **walker.rout.ca** and view it there. In order to get into the store, one must input their gender (male or female), and their shoe size. If the shoe size does not meet the criteria, the user will be kicked from the store. If the shoe size meets to criteria, the user will see a page displaying their information, along with a message saying their request is being processed.
